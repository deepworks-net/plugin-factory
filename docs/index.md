# Plugin Factory Documentation

## Overview
The Plugin-Factory is a lightweight jQuery plugin that quickly and easily adds new plugins to jQuery without the need to worry about replicating standard jQuery plugin boilerplate code. The Plugin-Factory also can extend other plugins added with the factory (similar to class inheritance in OO languages like Java and C++) and can inherit/override parent functionality.

### Include The Plugin
To use the jQuery Plugin-Factory, just include the script file on your page:
```HTML
<script src="https://www.deepworks.net/plugins/plugin-factory/js/jquery.plugin-factory.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
